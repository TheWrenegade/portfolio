      <h2>ProWrite Project (Graduate Research Assistant & Assistant Project Manager)</h2>
      <p>
        I served as a graduate research assistant and assistant project manager during the final year of <strong>ProWrite</strong>, an NSF-funded, multi-institutional research project focused on developing real-time feedback on writing processes for undergraduate students composing argumentative essays. Working alongside an international team—many of whom are now collaborators on SourceWrite—the project aimed to prototype a tool that could capture and respond to students’ writing behaviors as they occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this role, I reported to the principal investigator and senior project manager, supporting high-level coordination while also taking ownership of specific administrative and research responsibilities. I managed the grant’s budget, overseeing all purchase planning and expense tracking across institutions, and ensuring compliance with funding guidelines. I also contributed to research operations by planning and coordinating data collection sessions, evaluating early-stage data for quality and usability, and supervising and training undergraduate research assistants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project followed a SCRUM approach, which I learned and applied to facilitate transparent collaboration across distributed teams and time zones. This experience helped me build foundational skills in project management, especially in budgeting, scheduling, and team coordination within complex research environments. I also became familiar with agile research workflows and iterative development cycles in interdisciplinary contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ProWrite project successfully produced a functional prototype, multiple academic presentations, and several publications. The lessons we learned—especially regarding user experience and feedback precision—informed the design of our next-stage tool, <strong>SourceWrite</strong>, for which I now serve as senior project manager. My experience on ProWrite provided the groundwork for that leadership role.

      <h2>SourceWrite Project (Senior Graduate Assistant & Project Manager)</h2>
      <p>
        I serve as the senior graduate assistant and project manager for <strong>SourceWrite</strong>, a multi-institutional, NSF-funded research project focused on developing educational technology that delivers automated, personalized, real-time feedback on students’ source-based writing. The project is a collaborative effort across three international universities and brings together interdisciplinary expertise in writing studies, learning sciences, and computer science.
      </p>
      <p>
        As project manager from the outset, I have played a central role in coordinating teams across institutions, overseeing both the strategic direction and daily operations of the project. I supervise undergraduate and graduate research assistants, and I lead goal-setting, task planning, and accountability efforts using a hybrid project management approach that balances flexibility with structure. This approach enables me to monitor progress across sub-teams, identify and resolve bottlenecks, and ensure that the project remains on track toward its milestones.
      </p>
      <p>
        My responsibilities include managing IRB protocols, overseeing participant recruitment and scheduling, handling technical aspects of data collection and storage, and preparing internal and external progress reports. I also lead regular cross-institutional meetings, ensure clear documentation of decisions and workflows, and facilitate communication among principal investigators and research staff. In addition to my logistical and administrative work, I contribute to the intellectual development of the project by helping design research protocols and review pilot data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the project is ongoing, we have successfully completed multiple rounds of development and testing, laying the foundation for future classroom implementation. The project has already yielded insights into how students engage with real-time writing feedback and has contributed to the creation of a scalable feedback engine. My leadership has been essential in aligning the project’s complex moving parts and supporting collaborative, timely, and high-quality research outcomes.
