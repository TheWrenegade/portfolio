      <h2>Why Project Management for Research?</h2>
      <p>Academic projects often lack the structure of industry teams but face even greater complexity. A federal grant proposal might include ambitious goals, multi-institutional teams, and a long-term vision—but little infrastructure to carry it out.</p>
      <p>That’s where I come in. With a strong foundation in both research and project management, I help teams:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Translate grant goals into actionable timelines and check-ins</li>
        <li>Keep brilliant ideas documented and prioritized for future proposals</li>
        <li>Support collaborators with clear expectations, transparent authorship plans, and thoughtful communication</li>
        <li>Reduce friction so researchers can focus on what they do best</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tools &amp; Approach</h2>
      <p>My project management style is structured but flexible, blending the best of academic and industry approaches.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Planning:</strong> I use team charters, semester-based planning, and Gantt charts to map dependencies and manage long timelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> I prioritize transparency and frequent check-ins, using Slack, GitHub, and Microsoft Teams to maintain a shared record of work and goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Methods:</strong> I draw on SCRUM, Kanban, and agile-inspired approaches as needed, tailoring each system to the team’s phase and needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance &amp; Budgeting:</strong> I help teams build sustainable habits around budgeting and reporting, treating grant documents as living guides rather than bureaucratic hurdles.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Sets Me Apart</h2>
      <p>In a field where project management is often an afterthought, I bring intentionality and adaptability. I built systems from scratch in a department without PM infrastructure—pulling in best practices from business, engineering, and design to fit academic work.</p>
      <p>I understand how to navigate collaboration as both a peer and a facilitator, especially when power dynamics are uneven.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <em>“I’m hearing you say this. Here’s how I see it relating to what the other PI said. Is this correct?”</em><br />
        — Empathy is a project management tool.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Where I thrive is long-term planning and people-first mediation. I believe in setting up systems that make the invisible parts of academic labor—like cross-time-zone coordination and publication authorship—visible and equitable.</p>

      <h2>Future Goals</h2>
      <p>With my PMP, I hope to consult on large-scale research projects in the liberal arts and human sciences—fields that don’t often have lab infrastructure but are increasingly pursuing ambitious, interdisciplinary work. My goal is to help researchers do more of what matters by creating scaffolding that supports collaboration, compliance, and discovery.</p>
