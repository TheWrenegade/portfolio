  <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

  <blockquote>
    “Wren doesn’t feel like a friend, but she doesn’t feel like an intimidating teacher either... She holds herself with great poise while also showing she is caring about YOU, not just your grades.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This student comment captures the balance I strive for in every classroom: rigorous, reflective teaching paired with genuine human connection. My teaching philosophy centers on empowering students to grow as thinkers and writers by developing transferable skills, participating in authentic communication, and learning in an environment where their identities and experiences are seen and respected.
  </p>

  <h3>Empowering Student Growth Through Writing</h3>
  <p>
    My aim as a writing instructor is to help students understand not just how to write particular formats—proposals, arguments, narratives—but why and when those choices matter. I focus on teaching rhetorical principles like audience awareness, evidence selection, and strategic style, which students can apply across disciplines and careers. Writing is not just a skill; it's a way of thinking.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “The thorough instruction Wren gave the class was very helpful... if I had questions, she was always willing to help.”
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    “Wren made an environment that was a lot more lively... I paid a lot more attention to what was happening.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    My instruction blends modeling, scaffolded practice, and iterative feedback. I often offer both long and short versions of assignment guidelines to accommodate different processing needs—an approach students have called out as especially helpful.
  </p>

  <h3>Inclusive and Responsive Teaching</h3>
  <p>
    Students bring a rich variety of experiences, needs, and goals into the writing classroom. I strive to foster a space where those identities are welcomed and connected to course content. By practicing empathy and setting thoughtful boundaries as an instructor, I aim to model respectful engagement and reflection.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “Wren is an absolutely astonishing teacher in the way that she openly communicated with her students... I have never had a teacher in college whom I felt I could be this honest with.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    When students feel respected and understood, they’re more likely to take creative and intellectual risks. I encourage iteration, risk-taking, and failure as part of the writing process. I also adapt to student feedback each semester, revising my materials and methods to better meet their evolving needs.
  </p>

  <h3>Real-World Writing and Civic Engagement</h3>
  <p>
    I design my courses around the belief that writing is a civic and personal act. Assignments often ask students to write in real-world genres—letters to the editor, personal statements, proposals—so they can see the impact of clear, ethical communication.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “She connected with the class more than I expected a gen ed instructor to... She created a great learning environment and was always willing to help.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    In addition to academic skills, I emphasize critical media literacy, helping students analyze sources, identify persuasive strategies, and participate meaningfully in the conversations that shape their communities.
  </p>

  <p>
    I continually reassess my teaching through reflection, student writing, and course feedback. But what stays consistent is my commitment to helping students grow as ethical, effective communicators. If they leave my course able to thoughtfully answer “but why?”—and to challenge others to do the same—I’ll consider it a success.

  <p><strong>Student Feedback</strong></p>
  <blockquote>“The thorough instruction that Wren gave the class was very helpful. I am someone who usually has a lot of questions and most were
answered just by her instruction, and if they werent she was always willing to help.”</blockquote>
  <blockquote>“This is the second time I have taken this course. The previous instructor wasn't bad, but Wren made an environment that was a lot more
lively, which made the class not as boring as the first time. I paid a lot more attention to what was happening, and she was really good
about answering all the questions I had with the assignments. She connected with the class more than I expected a gen ed instructor to,
which was helpful as well. The assignment instructions were long, so she would also make a shorter version to read to get the gist of
things, and then I would go back and read the original instructions for more details.”</blockquote>
  <blockquote>“Wren Bouwman was an excellent professor that was very helpful at all times no matter when outside of class and did anything that was
available in order to help students that were stuck or needed help!”</blockquote>
  <blockquote>“Wren Bouwman has been an amazing English 150 instructor. She is an extremely well-spoken individual and is very clear on all of her
assignments. I found her class discussions and activities helped me learn throughout the semester and prepared me for our projects. She
created a great learning environment and was always willing to help students.”</blockquote>
  <blockquote>"Wren helped me the most. Wren is and was an absolutely astonishing teacher in the way that she openly communicated with her students.
Anytime I had any drawback, Wren would always help me work around it. It could be anything from an assignment, to missing class. I have
never had a teacher in college whom I felt I could be this honest with. She doesn't feel like a friend, but she doesn't feel like an intimidating
teacher either. She holds herself with great poise while also showing she is caring about YOU, not just your grades."</blockquote>
